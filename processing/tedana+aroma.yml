    Nuisance regressors were selected according to the 'tedana+aroma' strategy.
    First, the ICA-AROMA algorithm was applied to the MNI152NLin6Asym 2 mm resolution BOLD data,
    using fMRIPost-AROMA [@pruim2015ica].
    Next, the mixing matrix from ICA-AROMA was provided to tedana [CITE],
    using the "minimal" decision tree.
    The union of AROMA motion-labeled components and tedana non-BOLD components
    was selected as nuisance regressors.
    Finally, the nuisance components were orthogonalized with respect to the
    signal components not flagged as noise by either tedana or ICA-AROMA.
    This set of orthogonalized nuisance components was selected for the nuisance regression.
