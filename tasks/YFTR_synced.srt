1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,066
Hello, I'm Remy,
and this is my brother, Emile.

2
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:09,499
Hi.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,809
We're here to speak out on behalf

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,169
of oppressed rats everywhere.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:35,489
Oh, man.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,743
Rats who don't have the access

7
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:17,279
to media that our movie affords us.

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,819
We're speaking out? 
Yes, we have to.

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,339
We rats need to take a stand.

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,269
You said we'd sing something. You know, joke around.

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,747
You did not say we were gonna take a stand.

12
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:26,933
This is important.

13
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:29,149
Humans need to know.
Humans need to...

14
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,849
Feed us.
That's what you need to do.

15
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,429
Leave some garbage out and 
we won't bother you.

16
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,149
Just leave the lid on top of the can loose...

17
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,719
REMY: All right, all right, moving on.

18
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,058
This is a man.

19
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,168
Hello.

20
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:42,260
A dog, man's best friend,

21
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:44,103
looks up to man.

22
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:47,849
A cat looks down on man.

23
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,849
We rats see ourselves as equal to man,

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,249
but you humans don't seem to see it that way.

25
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,850
So it's been war,
a war without end!

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,954
But this has not always been true.

27
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:08,734
When has it not?

28
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,029
 In India, the rat is the chosen mode of conveyance

29
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,142
for the Hindu god, Ganesh, and thus, sacred.

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,601
During the Roman Empire,

31
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:21,210
اit was said to be good luck to have a

32
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,850
white rat cross your path.

33
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,449
Not so good if a black rat crossed it.

34
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,869
Rattus rattus, the black rat,
arrived in the West first,

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,645
hitching a ride with the returning Crusaders.

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,789
In Europe, finding plenty of filth,
grain, filth, and...

37
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,849
-Don't forget filth.
-And more filth to eat

38
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,042
the black rat quickly prospered.

39
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,849
Wait, wait, this is all wrong.
This isn't how we rehearsed it.

40
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,109
DIRECTOR: What, what's the problem?

41
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,239
It doesn't go from rats and darkness
to rats and death skulls.

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,329
- Well, my script says rats and death skulls.

43
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,049
You forgot the flea!

44
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,669
Rats didn't cause the plague,
the flea caused the plague.

45
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,319
The flea is the whole point!

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,350
DIRECTOR: Just give him the flea.

47
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,580
FLEA: I'm in need of your assis...
REMY: No, not that one.

48
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,308
- There it is.
- Oh, that's disgus...

49
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,849
Xenopsylla cheopis,
the rat flea.

50
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:32,089
See, this guy here gave the plague
to this guy here, a rat,

51
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,704
killing the rat.

52
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:36,118
Once the flea senses the cold, dead rat,

53
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:38,349
it prefers to find a warm, live rat.

54
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,850
But, if a human happens to come along, well...

55
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,849
From 1347 to 1352,  the plague,

56
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,929
or Black Death,

57
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,379
killed a third of the population of 14th century Europe,

58
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,029
and just as many, if not more, rats.

59
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,792
So, so what stopped the plague?

60
00:03:02,793 --> 00:03:04,449
No one really knows.

61
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,569
Maybe soap, closed sewers, a change in temperature.

62
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,290
Or some believe,

63
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,349
this guy,
rattus norvegicus,

64
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,250
the brown rat, better known as the Norway rat.

65
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:21,350
- That's us, right?
- Right.

66
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,549
The Norway rat came from China,

67
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,119
and according to mythology, brought the gift of rice to man.

68
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,259
Wait, wait. 
The Norway rat came from China?

69
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,180
Yes,
the rat even holds the place of honor

70
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,849
as the first year of the Chinese zodiac,

71
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,699
a symbol of good luck, wealth,
intelligence, charm, charisma,

72
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,549
ambition, adaptability, versatility... 
Shall I go on?

73
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,049
You're not making any sense.
We came from China, but we're called Norway rats?

74
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,339
I'm getting to that.

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,369
British naturalist, John Berkenhour,
named us Norway rats,

76
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,849
believing we had come to England
on a Norweigian boat.

77
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,979
the silly thing is
the brown rat didn't live in Norway at the time,

78
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,469
more than likely, we came from Denmark,

79
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,143
but the name just stuck.

80
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,983
Wait, now we're from Denmark?

81
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:08,606
Let it go.

82
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,459
Kicked out of Europe by his brawnier cousin,

83
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,379
the black rat joined explorers and colonists
seeking opportunity, and some elbow room,

84
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,870
 across the globe.

85
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,109
It wasn't until 1775 that the first Norway rats
arrived in America,

86
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,623
much to the chagrin of the established black rats.

87
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,949
Adaptable like humans,
Norway rats live throughout the world,

88
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,015
except the North Pole and South Pole.

89
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,206
What about that spot?

90
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:03,991
That's Alberta, Canada.

91
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:08,049
In 1950, rats invaded on the southeast border of Alberta,

92
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,150
but were repelled 
by an impressive government rat control program.

93
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,849
Our societies are intertwined,

94
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,384
a symbiotic relationship of give and take.

95
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:38,849
- You give us your trash, and we...
- Take it, then eat it.

96
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,849
- I don't understand it, myself.
- Can we sing the song now?

97
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,239
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop.
- We'll follow you to Mar...

98
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,289
Now, "Why Rats Are Cool."

99
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,849
- Every day, rats eat ten...
- Hey, wait.

100
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,850
You said I could do this part.

101
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,749
It's a little something I'm calling,

102
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,199
 "What's Cool About Rats."

103
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,849
Every day rats eat 10 percent of our bodyweight.

104
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,349
Gotta love that.

105
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,999
Our favorite foods are scrambled eggs, 
macaroni and cheese, white bread.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,349
I'm getting hungry.

107
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:16,069
Our teeth can cut through solid wood, lead pipe,

108
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,149
cinder blocks,

109
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,849
even steel,

110
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,850
with a biting force of 24,000 pounds per square inch.

111
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,299
A rat can swim for three days,

112
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,950
and yes, we can enter your home through the toilet.

113
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,850
Very flexible, we can squeeze through 
any hole we can get our head into.

114
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,229
One pair of rats can have 15,000 descendants in a year.

115
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,049
That may not sound good to you,
but it's good for us,

116
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,850
since the world is out to get us.

117
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,775
Whoa!

118
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,849
On Eniwetok Atoll, atomic bombs were tested for ten years,

119
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,697
but we rats survived,

120
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:10,350
and suffered no ill effects from the massive radiation.

121
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,539
Some people have pet rats, called fancy rats.

122
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,149
Why are they called fancy rats?

123
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,149
Keep going.

124
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,949
Okay.

125
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,855
Jack Black,
royal rat catcher to Queen Victoria,

126
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:26,579
liked to keep some of the rats he caught as pets.

127
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,425
These he would give to the fancy people of the day.

128
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:31,749
Oh, yeah, that's right. I remember now.

129
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,849
Many, many rats have dedicated their lives

130
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,469
investigating humanity's most dreaded diseases.

131
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,049
How is this possible?

132
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,929
Well, we share a similar biology.

133
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,649
We grow old the same way.

134
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,449
Treatments can be tested in a rat's lifespan of a year or two

135
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,850
that would take 70 years in a human.

136
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,349
Rats have even been to space,

137
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,150
teaching people about how the body 
adapts to weightlessness.

138
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,049
So, as you can see,

139
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,049
we've been together since the dawn of time,

140
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,250
and we'll be together far into the future.

141
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,989
