00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,216
Hello, I'm Remy,
and this is my brother, Emile.

2
00:00:18,217 --> 00:00:18,649
Hi.

3
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,959
We're here to speak out on behalf

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,319
of oppressed rats everywhere.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:44,639
Oh, man.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,893
Rats who don't have the access

7
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,429
to media that our movie affords us.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,969
We're speaking out? 
Yes, we have to.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,489
We rats need to take a stand.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,419
You said we'd sing something. You know, joke around.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,897
You did not say we were gonna take a stand.

12
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:36,083
This is important.

13
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:38,299
Humans need to know.
Humans need to...

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,999
Feed us.
That's what you need to do.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,579
Leave some garbage out and 
we won't bother you.

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,299
Just leave the lid on top of the can loose...

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,869
REMY: All right, all right, moving on.

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,208
This is a man.

19
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:49,318
Hello.

20
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:51,410
A dog, man's best friend,

21
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:53,253
looks up to man.

22
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,999
A cat looks down on man.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,999
We rats see ourselves as equal to man,

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,399
but you humans don't seem to see it that way.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,000
So it's been war,
a war without end!

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,104
But this has not always been true.

27
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:17,884
When has it not?

28
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:21,179
 In India, the rat is the chosen mode of conveyance

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,292
for the Hindu god, Ganesh, and thus, sacred.

30
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,751
During the Roman Empire,

31
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:30,360
اit was said to be good luck to have a

32
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,000
white rat cross your path.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,599
Not so good if a black rat crossed it.

34
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,019
Rattus rattus, the black rat,
arrived in the West first,

35
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,795
hitching a ride with the returning Crusaders.

36
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,939
In Europe, finding plenty of filth,
grain, filth, and...

37
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,999
-Don't forget filth.
-And more filth to eat

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,192
the black rat quickly prospered.

39
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,999
Wait, wait, this is all wrong.
This isn't how we rehearsed it.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,259
DIRECTOR: What, what's the problem?

41
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,389
It doesn't go from rats and darkness
to rats and death skulls.

42
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,479
- Well, my script says rats and death skulls.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,199
You forgot the flea!

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,819
Rats didn't cause the plague,
the flea caused the plague.

45
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,469
The flea is the whole point!

46
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,500
DIRECTOR: Just give him the flea.

47
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,730
FLEA: I'm in need of your assis...
REMY: No, not that one.

48
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,458
- There it is.
- Oh, that's disgus...

49
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,999
Xenopsylla cheopis,
the rat flea.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,239
See, this guy here gave the plague
to this guy here, a rat,

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,854
killing the rat.

52
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:45,268
Once the flea senses the cold, dead rat,

53
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,499
it prefers to find a warm, live rat.

54
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,000
But, if a human happens to come along, well...

55
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,999
From 1347 to 1352,  the plague,

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,079
or Black Death,

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,529
killed a third of the population of 14th century Europe,

58
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,179
and just as many, if not more, rats.

59
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,942
So, so what stopped the plague?

60
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,599
No one really knows.

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,719
Maybe soap, closed sewers, a change in temperature.

62
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,440
Or some believe,

63
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:23,499
this guy,
rattus norvegicus,

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,400
the brown rat, better known as the Norway rat.

65
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:30,500
- That's us, right?
- Right.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,699
The Norway rat came from China,

67
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,269
and according to mythology, brought the gift of rice to man.

68
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,409
Wait, wait. 
The Norway rat came from China?

69
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,330
Yes,
the rat even holds the place of honor

70
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,999
as the first year of the Chinese zodiac,

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,849
a symbol of good luck, wealth,
intelligence, charm, charisma,

72
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,699
ambition, adaptability, versatility... 
Shall I go on?

73
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,199
You're not making any sense.
We came from China, but we're called Norway rats?

74
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,489
I'm getting to that.

75
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,519
British naturalist, John Berkenhour,
named us Norway rats,

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,999
believing we had come to England
on a Norweigian boat.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,129
the silly thing is
the brown rat didn't live in Norway at the time,

78
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,619
more than likely, we came from Denmark,

79
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,293
but the name just stuck.

80
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:16,133
Wait, now we're from Denmark?

81
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:17,756
Let it go.

82
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,609
Kicked out of Europe by his brawnier cousin,

83
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:27,529
the black rat joined explorers and colonists
seeking opportunity, and some elbow room,

84
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,020
 across the globe.

85
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,259
It wasn't until 1775 that the first Norway rats
arrived in America,

86
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,773
much to the chagrin of the established black rats.

87
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,099
Adaptable like humans,
Norway rats live throughout the world,

88
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,165
except the North Pole and South Pole.

89
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,356
What about that spot?

90
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:13,141
That's Alberta, Canada.

91
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:17,199
In 1950, rats invaded on the southeast border of Alberta,

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,300
but were repelled 
by an impressive government rat control program.

93
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,999
Our societies are intertwined,

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,534
a symbiotic relationship of give and take.

95
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:47,999
- You give us your trash, and we...
- Take it, then eat it.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,999
- I don't understand it, myself.
- Can we sing the song now?

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,389
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop.
- We'll follow you to Mar...

98
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,439
Now, "Why Rats Are Cool."

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,999
- Every day, rats eat ten...
- Hey, wait.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You said I could do this part.

101
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,899
It's a little something I'm calling,

102
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,349
 "What's Cool About Rats."

103
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,999
Every day rats eat 10 percent of our bodyweight.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,499
Gotta love that.

105
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,149
Our favorite foods are scrambled eggs, 
macaroni and cheese, white bread.

106
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,499
I'm getting hungry.

107
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,219
Our teeth can cut through solid wood, lead pipe,

108
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,299
cinder blocks,

109
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,999
even steel,

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
with a biting force of 24,000 pounds per square inch.

111
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,449
A rat can swim for three days,

112
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,100
and yes, we can enter your home through the toilet.

113
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,000
Very flexible, we can squeeze through 
any hole we can get our head into.

114
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,379
One pair of rats can have 15,000 descendants in a year.

115
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,199
That may not sound good to you,
but it's good for us,

116
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
since the world is out to get us.

117
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,925
Whoa!

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,999
On Eniwetok Atoll, atomic bombs were tested for ten years,

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,847
but we rats survived,

120
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:19,500
and suffered no ill effects from the massive radiation.

121
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,689
Some people have pet rats, called fancy rats.

122
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,299
Why are they called fancy rats?

123
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,299
Keep going.

124
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,099
Okay.

125
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,005
Jack Black,
royal rat catcher to Queen Victoria,

126
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:35,729
liked to keep some of the rats he caught as pets.

127
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,575
These he would give to the fancy people of the day.

128
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:40,899
Oh, yeah, that's right. I remember now.

129
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,999
Many, many rats have dedicated their lives

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,619
investigating humanity's most dreaded diseases.

131
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,199
How is this possible?

132
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,079
Well, we share a similar biology.

133
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,799
We grow old the same way.

134
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,599
Treatments can be tested in a rat's lifespan of a year or two

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,000
that would take 70 years in a human.

136
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,499
Rats have even been to space,

137
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,300
teaching people about how the body 
adapts to weightlessness.

138
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,199
So, as you can see,

139
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,199
we've been together since the dawn of time,

140
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,400
and we'll be together far into the future.

141
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,139

REMY: Oh, no. Oh, this isn't over yet.

177
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,499
Oh, no, no.

178
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,319
Emile, how many times did I say they were gonna

179
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,199

You've had your say.

188
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,999
